zf2j

After you press j, Vim will create a fold covering three lines -- the
line you started the fold on, and the next two lines. If you're familiar with
Vim's movement commands, you know that the command 2j would usually tell Vim to
move down two lines. Vim uses the same movement commands to define folds.


zd		Delete one fold at the cursor.  When the cursor is on a folded
		line, that fold is deleted.  Nested folds are moved one level
		up.  In Visual mode all folds (partially) in the selected area
		are deleted.  Careful: This easily deletes more folds than you
		expect and there is no undo.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		Also see |fold-delete-marker|.
